### What's the problem

When using libraries like [robotjs](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs), [nut.js](https://github.com/nut-tree/nut.js), you'll find that the code cannot get real pixel location. 

### How to fix

1. Right click on `node.exe`, click properties
2. Go to `Compatibility` tab
3. Click `Change high DPI settings` button
4. Check `Override high DPI scaling behavior`
5. Set `Scaling performed by` to `Application`
