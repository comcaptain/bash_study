[Install - Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

# 1. Install SDK

- Download the zip file
- Unzip the zip file to somewhere, e.g. `C:\MyPrograms\flutter`
- Add `flutter\bin` to path
- Run command `flutter doctor` to verify the installation

# 2. Install android environment

Unluckily on windows there is no official way to run flutter app on your iPhone. So I'll use android instead

- Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and install it

# 3. Setup IntelliJ

- Install `Flutter` plugin

# 4. Run hello world app

- Create a flutter project
- Configure dark sdk in run configuration
- Go to `Tools -> Android -> SDK manager` to configure android SDK
- Build project and it would complain about missing SDK. Then configure it with android sdk
