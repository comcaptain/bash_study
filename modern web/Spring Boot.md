## What is spring boot?

> Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

- It's not a web server. It's just a basic framework of other spring frameworks
- For example, if you want to turn it into a web server, you can add either of following 2 spring frameworks:
  - Spring Web. Or you can call it Spring MVC
  - Spring Reactive Web. Or you can call it Spring WebFlux
- You can get a clear picture from [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
