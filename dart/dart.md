### [Youtube: Why Flutter uses dart?](https://youtu.be/5F-6n_2XWR8)

Flutter is a framework that develops apps for IOS, Android and Web.

Flutter has following goals:

- Write once, run everywhere (IOS, Android and Web)\
- Fast development experience

Dart is chosen because:

- Write once, run everywhere
- It compiles to platform's native code, so it's fast
- It has a hot-reload feature. Code change can be applied to your app almost immediately without re-compiling, restarting...
- Easy to learn for java/swift/js developers
- Optimized for writing UI
