# Package Manager

## NPM or Yarn

There is a good comparison article: [Choosing Between NPM and Yarn | Engineering Education (EngEd) Program | Section](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/npm-vs-yarn-which-one-to-choose/)

For now. I'll choose NPM because it's kind of more popular and I'm not doing nodejs development

## NPX

A new tool in npm. With it, you can execute a nodejs without installing it

```bash
# Even though you didn't ever install create-react-app. This command would automatically install for u and execute it
# NOTE: Unlike npm install, this installation is not a permanent installation
npx create-react-app my-app
```
